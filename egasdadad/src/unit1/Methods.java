    /*
      Methods help you modularize a program by separating its tasks into self-contained units.

      Pros:
      - Written only once â€“ no repeated code
      - Methods can be reused (invoked, called) from several locations in a program
      - Divide and conquer approach - Constructing programs from small, simple pieces
      - Software reusability - Use existing methods/classes as building blocks to create new programs.
      - Dividing a program into meaningful methods/classes makes the program easier to debug and maintain.

    Part 2 - Parts of a method
    a) You notice the javadoc comment above the method - this explains what the method is doing, if it has any input, and if it has any output
    b) public -> means this method is usable anywhere
    c) static -> means this method acts like a function - there are no "things" using the method
    d) int -> the value that is gotten as a result of the method; the *return value*
    e) doubleNumber -> the name of the method; how we will be able to use it in the code
    f) int num -> the values we need in order for the method to work, and what we will call it in the method; the *parameter*
        the *parameter* -> what the name of the variable which will hold the value is
        the *argument* -> the actual value that is passed into the method
